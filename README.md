## Blog App

This assigment was part of the The Odin Prject course and it was to create a blogging application follwing [this guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html). 

It was a fun project as it let me play around with the structure of a Rails app and I began to understand the realtionship between Routes, Models and Controllers much better than a textbook was able to do. I also familiarised myself with the common Rails commands and naming conventions. 

Whilst the main purpose of this project was to understand the inner workings of a rails app. I thought it woukd fun to use a Tailwindcss to style my app a little better. I followed a guide online and integrated Tailwindcss using Webpack and also purged the bloat that it comes with so the page speed is accetpable.
